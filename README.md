# Project Objective: Problem Statement
The Project aims at finding answers to the following questions:

1. Yearly how many planes crashed? how many people were on board? how many survived? how many died?
2. Highest number of crashes by operator and Type of aircrafts.
3. What are the prevalent causes of aircraft crashes? 
4. The number of crashed aircrafts and number of fatalities by the causes
5. Could there be any trend of events between the crashes over the years?

# Data Sourcing
Thia dataset was gotten from Kaggle, a site for getting datasets
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908


---
# Data Transformation
1.I renamed the dataset to a shorter name(Airplane Crashes)
2. I deleted some colums, cleaned, trimmed, renamed and created some other ones
3. I also created a date table

Data Analysis
The Report Consists of three pages.

2. Picture B explores the data and answered questions 1 and 2 of the objective questions.
It also shows the trend between airplane crashes between the top 5 years

# Findings and recommendation based on the insight
1. Plane Crashes are most likely caused by weather condition; Airline operators should make good use of weather forecast information in planning flights time
2. Manufacturers should make use of durable and trusted materials in making airplanes, so as to avoid technical failure. Also, proper maintenance should be carried out on airplanes on the part of the operators.
3. Passengers should avoid smoking while on board.
4. Improved taking off and landing techniques will help to reduce crashes
