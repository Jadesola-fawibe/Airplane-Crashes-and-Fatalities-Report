# Project Objective: Problem Statement
The Project aims at finding answers to the following questions:

1. Yearly how many planes crashed? how many people were on board? how many survived? how many died?
2. Highest number of crashes by operator and Type of aircrafts.
3. What are the prevalent causes of aircraft crashes? 
4. The number of crashed aircrafts and number of fatalities by the causes
5. Coud there be any trend of events between the crashes over the years?

# Data Sourcing
The data was gotten from Kaggle, a site for getting datasets
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908

# Data Transformation
1.I renamed the dataset to a shorter name(Airplane Crashes)
2. I deleted some colums, cleaned, trimmed, renamed and created some other ones
3. I also created a date table

# Findings and recommendation based on the insight
1. Plane Crashes are most likely caused by weather condition; Airline operators should make good use of weather forecast information in planning flights time
2. Manufacturers should make us of durable and trusted materials in making airplanes, so as to avoid technical failure. Also, proper maintenance should be carrie out on airplanes on the part of the operators.
3. Passengers should avoid smoking while on board.
4. Improved taking of and landing techniques will help to reduce crashes
